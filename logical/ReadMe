 This install applies to "Logical" © 1991 Raimbow Arts.

 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 1 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts"
 and must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from an
 A500 with tools like "GrabKick" or similar which can be found on Aminet.
 If the image is the wrong version or altered in any way, WHDLoad will
 quit with an appropriate error message.

 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive
 "util/boot/skick343.lha" on Aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page.
